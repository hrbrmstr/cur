Display current conditions from [Weatherflow Tempest](https://observablehq.com/@hrbrmstr/weatherflow-tempest-obs_st-record-handling) UDP `obs_st` broadcast messages via Rust's {[pancurses](https://docs.rs/pancurses/latest/pancurses/)} crate.

Pretty much just a toy / WIP project to get familiar with {[pancurses](https://docs.rs/pancurses/latest/pancurses/)}.

Displays a few, selected measurements in the upper-right corner of a terminal until a key is pressed.
